# Detecting Distracted Driving Using Computer Vision Techniques
**Authors:** Aziz Shaik and Rayden Dodd  
**Course:** ECE 5554: Computer Vision (Fall 2025)

This project explores the use of computer vision techniques to detect distracted driving behaviors in real time. By leveraging deep learning models trained on labeled image data, we aim to classify driver states such as safe, distracted, sleepy, or engaging in risky behaviors.
