        <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>
            Distracted driving is a leading cause of accidents around the world, posing a serious threat to public safety.
            Many modern vehicles incorporate systems to ensure drivers are focused by limiting interface access or flashing a warning when
            it detects irregular driving. However, these systems primarily respond to interactions with the vehicle itself and often 
            fail to capture the broader spectrum of risky driving behaviors.
        </p>
        <p>
            The core challenge presented by this problem lies in accurately identifying specific driver behaviors in real time using visual 
            data, with operator actions such as phone usage, eating, or signs of tiredness, and making intelligent decisions based on the 
            severity of the behavior. A system capable of detecting these patterns could help deter dangerous conduct and contribute to a 
            safer travel experience for passengers and nearby drivers.

        <h2>Approach</h2>
        <p>
            Describe the technical approach that you plan to employ.

        <h2>Plans for Experiments</h2>
        <p>
            Describe the experimental setup you will follow. Describe the datasets you
            plan to use, what code you will implement yourself, what existing code you will borrow (if any), and
            what you would define as a success for the project. If you intend to collect your own data, provide a
            description of the procedure that you will follow. Provide a list of experiments that you will perform.
            Describe what you expect the experiments to reveal, or what is uncertain about the potential
            outcomes.
